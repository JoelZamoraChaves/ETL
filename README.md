# ETL Pipeline in Python

This repository contains a Python script for an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline designed to efficiently process and integrate data from multiple sources into a unified format. ETL processes are crucial for preparing data for analytics, reporting, or storage purposes, ensuring consistency and quality throughout the data lifecycle.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Utilizes various methods to extract data from .csv, .json and .xml files.
- **Data Transformation**: Applies comprehensive transformations including cleaning, metric convertion, and aggregating to harmonize data structure and quality.
- **Data Loading**: Efficiently loads processed data into a new .csv file, ensuring seamless integration.

## Usage
**Run ETL Process**: Execute `etl_code.py` to initiate the ETL pipeline and monitor logs for progress and errors.
